# wheat-Ptr-WGCNA

# Overview

This repository contains the code and data for a Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) performed on wheat and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr). The analysis aims to identify gene modules that are significantly associated with Ptr-resistance in wheat, particularly in relation to the pathogenic interactions between wheat and Ptr.

# Contents

FunctionalAnnotation.csv: Functional annotations of the genes used in the WGCNA analysis.

traitData.csv: Trait data for wheat samples, including phenotypic and treatments information relevant to the analysis.

wheat-Ptr-WGCNA.R: R script for performing the WGCNA analysis on the wheat-Ptr dataset, including data pre-processing, network construction, and module-trait relationship analysis.

inputWGCNA.csv: Input data matrix used for WGCNA, containing gene expression data for wheat samples.
